# Design Document: Appointment Booking System

## Overview

The Appointment Booking System for MotherCare gynecologist specialist hospital will provide patients with a seamless, user-friendly interface to schedule appointments with doctors based on service needs and availability. This design document outlines the technical approach, architecture, data models, and component structure that will be implemented to meet the requirements specified in the requirements document.

The system will be built using Next.js 14 with the App Router, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements. It will follow healthcare best practices including WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility, secure handling of patient data, and mobile-first design principles.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The appointment booking system will follow a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Next.js 14 App Router for page routing and server components
   - React components for UI rendering
   - Client-side form validation with React Hook Form and Zod
   - State management using React Context API for appointment flow

2. **API Layer**:
   - Next.js API routes for handling appointment requests
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Integration with backend services

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Temporary data storage in JSON files for development
   - Integration points for hospital systems in production
   - Type-safe data models with TypeScript

4. **External Integrations**:
   - Calendar services (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)
   - Email notification service
   - SMS notification service (optional)
