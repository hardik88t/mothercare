# Design Document: MotherCare Hospital Website

## Overview

The MotherCare Hospital website will be a simple, informational website that provides visitors with essential information about the gynecologist specialist hospital and includes a contact form for inquiries. This design document outlines the technical approach, architecture, and component structure for a clean, accessible, and mobile-friendly hospital website.

The system will be built using Next.js 14 with the App Router, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements. It will follow healthcare best practices including WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility and mobile-first design principles.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The hospital website will follow a simple client-side architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Next.js 14 App Router for page routing and server components
   - React components for UI rendering
   - Client-side form validation with React Hook Form and Zod

2. **API Layer**:
   - Next.js API routes for handling contact form submissions
   - Email service integration for form notifications

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Static data for services and doctor information
   - Type-safe data models with TypeScript

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

  specializations: string[];
  imageUrl: string;
  bio: string;
  experience: string; // Years of experience
}
```

### Service

```typescript
interface Service {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'obstetrics' | 'gynecology' | 'laparoscopy' | 'infertility';
  icon: string; // Icon name for display
}
```

### ContactForm

```typescript
interface ContactFormData {
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email: string;
  message: string;
  preferredContact: 'phone' | 'email';
}
```

### HospitalInfo

```typescript
interface HospitalInfo {
  name: string;
  address: string;
  phone: string;
  emergencyPhone: string;
  email: string;
  hours: {
    weekdays: string;
    weekends: string;
    emergency: string;
  };
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Homepage Visit**:
   - User lands on homepage
   - Views hospital information, services, and doctor details
   - Sees prominent contact information

2. **Service Information**:
   - User navigates to Services page (optional)
   - Reviews available medical services
   - Gets detailed service descriptions

3. **Contact/Inquiry**:
   - User navigates to Contact page
   - Views hospital location, hours, and contact details
   - Fills out contact form for inquiries or appointment requests

4. **Form Submission**:
   - User submits contact form
   - System validates form data
   - User receives confirmation message
   - Hospital receives email notification

## Error Handling

### Form Validation Errors

- Real-time validation with clear error messages
- Field-specific error indicators
- Form submission blocked until errors are resolved
- Accessible error announcements for screen readers

### System Errors

- Graceful handling of API failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for administrator troubleshooting

### Edge Cases

- Handling high volume of contact form submissions
- Managing spam form submissions
- Handling email delivery failures
- Emergency contact information accessibility

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component-level tests for UI components
- Function-level tests for utility functions
- Validation logic tests

### Integration Testing

- Form submission flows
- API integration tests
- State management tests

### End-to-End Testing

- Complete contact form submission flow
- Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

### User Testing
